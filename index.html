                <h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>
                <p>Plastic solved many of our daily problems when it was invented. We could store items in containers
                    now, in our desired sizes, water in bottles, food in containers, trash in plastic bags. For years we
                    used plastic with no apparent consequence.
                    <br><br>
                    However, those times have changed. Now we know the harm that is brought upon oceans due to our
                    excessive use of plastic. It is no longer ok not to know about the problem.
                    <br><br>
                    Our problem now is not to single handedly clean up the ocean but make sure that all of us know about
                    the sustainable goals that companies can follow. Help us let the world know that being sustainable
                    isnt a practice that should be followed but that needs to be followed before anything else

                Below are a few of our current ambassadors. They serve as the
                cornerstone of communicating our mission at Copenhagen cartel to those
                we can’t reach. As you can see, caring about the ocean transcends
                borders, gender and anything in between.
